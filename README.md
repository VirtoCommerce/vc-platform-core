# Meet the new 3.0 major version of Virto Commerce platform 
Our development efforts were focused on moving to ASP.NET Core, performance, architecture improvements, further enhancements and fixing arhitectural bugs. 

## What were our objective when starting development project on VC platform v3? 

- Change primary technology stack to .NET Core for the platform application and all key modules. 
- Eliminate known technical and architecture design issues of 2.x version (Caching, Overloaded core module, Asynchronous code, Platform Complexity, Extensibility, Performance, Authentication and Authorization) 
- Provide easy and clear migration from 2.x version by preserving complete backward compatibility for API and Database Schema 
- The platform and 18 core modules were planned to be migrated. 

## Release status note 
- *We encourage you to try and investigate the new version of the product and give us your feedback*
- *This is a beta release, which hasn't been verified on a production project yet*
- *We have delivered a simple migration from 2.x version by preserving complete backward compatibility for API and Database Schema. You'll need an additional effort when there are custom changes in 2.x version. Please follow our migration guide during the project migration*
- **_We cannot guarantee the backward compatibility of current beta version with the final 3.X release_**

## The Virto Commerce Release Notes below are a subset of the larger list of changes in migration to ASP.NET Core. 

## What does Virto V3 provide to developers and architects?
- Improved extensibility and unification.
- Increase in development speed and decrease in time to market. 
- Unified architecture and usage of good architecture practices leads to shorter learning curve for developers who are new to working with Virto Commerce.

# Getting started:

## Precompiled binary getting started
- Download archive with platform precompiled version [VirtoCommerce.Platform.3.0.0.beta.zip](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-platform-core/releases/tag/v3.0.0.beta)
- Unpack follow zip to local disk to path `C:\vc-platform-3`. In result you should get the folder which contains platform precompiled code. 
- Run platform by command `dotnet.exe C:\vc-platform-3\VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web.dll`
- Open in your browser follow url `https://localhost:5001` in the warning for not private connections that appears click advanced and continue work.
- On the first request the application will create and initialize database. After that you should see the sign in page. Use the following credentials: `admin/store`

## Source code  getting started
   - Get the latest source code from `master` branch
   - Make a symlink for Modules folder 
   ```cmd 
   mklink /d C:\vc-platform-3\VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web\Modules C:\vc-platform-3\Modules
   ```
   - Open and compile platform solution `VirtoCommerce.Platform.sln` in any preffered IDE
   - Install Node.js dependencies. 
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   - build and pack js scripts and css for platform 
   ```
   npm run webpack:dev
   ```
   - repeat previous command for each module in `Modules` folder
   
## Run [storefront](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-storefront-core) with new platform version
- Deploy  the latest storefront version from `dev` branch by any of preffered way described there https://virtocommerce.com/docs/vc2devguide/deployment/storefront-deployment
- Make changes  in  `appsettings.json`    
```json
...
//Comment the follow settings
// "AppId": "...",
// "SecretKey": "..."
...
//Uncomment the follow settings
"UserName": "admin",
"Password": "store"
```

## Run platform with Http in development mode

### Using CLI in development mode
- Make shure that you have installed latest version of dot.net core SDK 2.2
- To run platform navigate to `VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web` folder via CLI and run `dotnet run -c Development --no-launch-profile`. You can add `--no-build` flag to speed up start if you already compile solution.
- Browse to `https://localhost:5001`

## Run platform with Https support

### Using VisualStudio
Open `VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web` project properties and in `Debug` section set checkbox - `Enable SSL`. VisualStudio can ask you to install Certificate, just accept and platform will be running with Https support.

### Using CLI with Https
- Make shure that you have installed latest version of dot.net core SDK 2.2
- Install SSL certificate with CLI command `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
- Restart your machine
- To run platform navigate to `VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web` folder via CLI and run `dotnet run -c Release --no-launch-profile`. You can add `--no-build` flag to speed up start if you already compile solution.
- Browse to `https://localhost:5001`


# How to debug module
- Install and run platform as described in steps above.
- Navigate into platform app directory and find `Modules` folder
- Clone a module from GitHub into `Modules` folder, if module already installed as binary just replace it folder
- Open and build  a module solution in Visual Studio
- Run platform by using CLI `dotnet run -c Development --no-build --no-restore` as described in steps above
- Attach debugger into `dotnet` process


# How to migrate your solution from 2.x to 3.0 platform version
- If your solution doesn't have any custom modules and extensions you just need to use the connection string to the old database for the new 3.0 platfrom version and after first run the update scripts will transfer all your data to the new scheme otherwise, you need to convert your models according to this instruction https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-platform-core/wiki/Migrate-Extension-module-from-the-Platform-2.0-to-3.0-version.
